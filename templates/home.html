<h3 class="mt-5">Excused Absences for College Visits</h3>

<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
  <p><strong>Did you know?</strong> Many schools in Georgia and South Carolina allow excused absences for official college visits — helping students explore their futures without penalty!</p>

  <ul class="mt-3">
    <li><strong>Georgia:</strong> Students in grades 9–12 can receive up to <strong>5 excused absences per school year</strong> for approved college visits. Some districts, like <strong>Columbia County</strong>, allow excused visits each semester for colleges over 50 miles away. Always check with your school's attendance office for details!</li>
    <li><strong>Richmond County:</strong> While not specifically detailed, college visits may be coordinated through your school's attendance office for excused consideration. Prior approval is highly recommended.</li>
    <li><strong>South Carolina:</strong> Formal college visits are excused absences — generally <strong>one day for juniors</strong> and <strong>two days for seniors</strong> — with proof of the visit required. Policies may vary by district, so be sure to verify with your school.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="mt-3">At College Bound Tours, we help make these visits easy, organized, and officially verifiable to support your student's academic journey.</p>
